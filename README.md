# Crisp

A minimalist, responsive, and open-source two-column theme for the [Ghost](http://ghost.org) publishing platform by [Kathy Qian](http://kathyqian.com). Last tested with Ghost v4. For the last version tested with pre-2.0 Ghost releases, see the [ghost-sub-2](https://github.com/kathyqian/crisp/tree/ghost-sub-2) branch.

### Required Steps for Installation

1. Download the files   
2. Configure the follow buttons in **partials/follow.hbs** (see section below)
3. Zip the files, upload through the Ghost admin panel, and activate

### Suggested Customizations

* Change the link color on *line 88* in **assets/styles/crisp.css**
* Add code for Google Analytics in **default.hbs** after `{{ghost_foot}}`
* Replace the Disqus universal embed code in **partials/comments.hbs**, or delete the #comments div to remove comments altogether
* Remove irrelevant social sharing services in **partials/share.hbs**, or change the colors of social sharing services in **assets/styles/rrssb.css**
* Change your blog logo to change the favicon and cover photo to change the sidebar background

### Editing Follow Buttons

Crisp uses Font Awesome for icons. See the Font Awesome documentation for the [full list of icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) and [usage tips](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/).

I have placed some common buttons in **follow.hbs**, with more options in the commented out sections. Make sure to replace the `username` in the URLs so the links point to your profiles.

### Credits

Many thanks to [@davegandy](http://twitter.com/davegandy) for the [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) icons used throughout the theme.

Social sharing buttons are a modified version of the [Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons](https://github.com/kni-labs/rrssb) by [@dbox](http://www.twitter.com/dbox) and [@seagoat](http://www.twitter.com/seagoat). Great job, guys!
